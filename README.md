I4.0-NEW is a new rewritten version of [I4.0](https://github.com/TAO71-AI/I4.0).

## Key features

## Requirements

### Client API (tested only in CLI)

TODO

### Main server

These requirements may change in the future because the server is not 100% done yet.

- OS: GNU/Linux recommended
- CPU: 2 or more cores
- RAM: ~256 MB/512 MB without models loaded, at least 4 GB recommended
- GPU: No GPU needed, but recommended to provide faster inference
- Disk: ~5 GB recommended (without models)
- Python: 3.11 recommended, might be compatible with more recent versions, but not tested enough

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The main server has only been tested using Arch Linux, but it's expected to work using other GNU/Linux distributions.
> Windows, MacOS, and any other OS that is not GNU/Linux-based is **NOT** expected to run the main server, but it might be compatible.

### Database server
