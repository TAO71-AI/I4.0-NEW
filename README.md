# I4.0-NEW

I4.0-NEW is a new rewritten version of [I4.0](https://github.com/TAO71-AI/I4.0).

## Key features

- **Fully modular**: By just adding or removing a directory you can activate or deactivate modules.
- **End-to-end encryption**: Keeps your data private even in unsecure communications.

## Requirements

### Client API (tested only in CLI)

- OS: Any
- CPU: 1 core required, 2 or more recommended
- RAM: ~64 MB for basic inference
- GPU: No GPU required
- Disk: ~100 MB
- Python: >=3.11

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The client has only been tested using Arch Linux for now, but it's expected to work using other GNU/Linux distributions or other Operating Systems such as Windows 10 or Windows 11.

### Server

These requirements may change in the future because the server is not 100% done yet.

- OS: GNU/Linux recommended
- CPU: 2 or more cores
- RAM: ~256 MB to start the server, at least 2 GB recommended to load models
- GPU: No GPU required, but recommended to provide faster inference
- Disk: 5 GB or more recommended (without models)
- Python: 3.11 recommended, might be compatible with more recent versions, but not tested enough

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The server has only been tested using Arch Linux, but it's expected to work using other GNU/Linux distributions.
> Windows, MacOS, and any other OS that is not GNU/Linux-based is **NOT** expected to run the server, but it might be compatible.
